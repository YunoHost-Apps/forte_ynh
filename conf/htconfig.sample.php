// Why .htconfig.php? Because it contains sensitive information which could
// give somebody complete control of your database. Apache's default
// configuration denies access to and refuses to serve any file beginning
// with .ht

// Then set the following for your MySQL installation

$db_host = 'localhost'; // Use 'localhost' if you aren't using a remote server
$db_port = 0;                    // leave 0 for default or set your port
$db_user = '__DB_USER__';
$db_pass = '__DB_PWD__';
$db_data = '__DB_NAME__';
$db_type = 0; // use 1 for postgres, 0 for mysql
$db_vrsn = ''; // Required for doctrine

/*
 * Notice: Many of the following settings will be available in the admin panel

 * are stored in the DB - and the DB setting will over-ride any corresponding
 * setting in this file
 *
 * The command-line tool util/config is able to query and set the DB items
 * directly if for some reason the admin panel is not available and a system
 * setting requires modification.
